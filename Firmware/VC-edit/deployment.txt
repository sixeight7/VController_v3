Deploy VC-edit for Mac:

1) Make sure Qt creator is set to Release (and not Debug) and run the app.
2) Deploy the app by running the following command in Terminal: ~/Qt/5.11.1/clang_64/bin/macdeployqt ~/qt-projects/build-VC-edit-Desktop_Qt_5_11_1_clang_64bit-Release/VC-edit.app ls -dmg -always-overwrite
3) The VC-edit.dmg file is in folder ~/qt-projects/build-VC-edit-Desktop_Qt_5_11_1_clang_64bit-Release/


Deploy VC-edit for Windows:
1) Make sure Qt creator is set to release (and not Debug) and compile and run the app.
2) Deploy the app by running the following commands in a command prompt:
   > cd C:\Users\HP\Documents\qt-projects\build-VC-edit-Desktop_Qt_5_11_1_MinGW_32bit-Release\packager
   > C:\Qt\5.11.1\mingw53_32\bin\windeployqt VC-edit.exe --compiler-runtime 



3) You may have to manually copy the following files from D:\Qt\5.10.1\mingw53_32\bin to 
   D:\qt-projects\build-VC-edit-Desktop_Qt_5_10_1_MinGW_32bit-Release\packager:
   - libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll
   - libstdc++-6.dll
   - libwinpthread-1.dll

Also for windeployqt to run, the D:\Qt\5.10.1\mingw53_32\bin folder must be in the PATH variable and there should be no link to other compilers here!

4) Copy the folder C:\Users\HP\Documents\qt-projects\build-VC-edit-Desktop_Qt_5_11_1_MinGW_32bit-Release\packager to C:\Users\HP\Documents\qt-projects\\Releases and rename the folder to VC-edit for Controller or VC-edit for VC-mini depending on the IS_VCMINI setting in config.h in Qt creator. Also add the proper version number. Then zip the folder.
